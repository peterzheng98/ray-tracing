# ray-tracing
Course Work Template for MS125/MS106 PPCA 2020
Github Action: ![rust-images](https://github.com/peterzheng98/ray-tracing/workflows/rust-images/badge.svg?branch=dev)

Estimated Plan:
- Make a glass ball with simple brute force path tracer. (Both)
- Add textures, volumes (like fog), rectangles, instances and lights and support for lots of objects using a BVH.(Both)
- Use Monte Carlo Method to make the picture less noisy. (ACM Class Only)

Categories: Computer Graphics(HEY! NOT COMPUTER VISION!)

You should prepare:
- A software to edit cpp files.
- A cpp compiler.(maybe gcc, clang or the compiler you made)
- Some math.

Enjoy!

## Environment Preparation
Python 3(Pillow, numpy)

## Stage 1: Make a simple brute force path tracer.
- 1.1: Learn about PPM Format. (Goal: 1-demo-ppm.png)
